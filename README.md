## Install

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/am-will/limux/releases).

**Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)** — recommended:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./limux_*_amd64.deb
```

**AppImage** — portable across Ubuntu 24.04-era desktops and newer, no install needed:
```bash
chmod +x Limux-*-x86_64.AppImage
./Limux-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

Release AppImages are built and checked on the Ubuntu 24.04 `GLIBC_2.39`
floor. They bundle Limux, Ghostty resources, WebKitGTK helper processes, and
AppImage-only loader modules such as the gdk-pixbuf SVG loader. They still use
the host GTK4 and libadwaita runtime, so older distributions may need the
`.deb`, tarball, or a source build with matching system packages instead.

The embedded [AppImage type-2 runtime](https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime)
statically includes FUSE 3, so the AppImage does not require a host
`libfuse.so.2` or `libfuse.so.3`. It works with versioned FUSE 3 helpers such as
`fusermount3` while retaining support for the traditional `fusermount` helper.
The launcher also discovers host GBM and DRI driver directories, allowing the
Ubuntu-built bundle to use Mesa correctly on Fedora- and Arch-family systems.

AppImage runtime library paths are scoped to the Limux app process. Terminals
spawned inside Limux restore the user's original library/loader environment so
host tools such as Flatpak do not load AppImage-private libraries first.

**Tarball** — manual install:
```bash
tar xzf limux-*-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd limux-*-linux-x86_64
sudo ./install.sh
```

**Arch Linux (AUR):**
```bash
# Prebuilt release package
yay -S limux-bin

# Build Limux and Ghostty from source
yay -S limux
```

Both [`limux-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/limux-bin) and the source-built [`limux`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/limux) package are published from this repository. Thanks to [Anton Barchukov](https://github.com/antonbarchukov) for creating the original Arch packaging in [PR #50](https://github.com/am-will/limux/pull/50).

To uninstall:
```bash
# deb
sudo apt remove limux

# tarball
sudo ./install.sh --uninstall
```

### System dependencies

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libgtk-4-1 libadwaita-1-0 libwebkitgtk-6.0-4
```

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable)
- Zig 0.16.0
- GTK4, libadwaita, WebKitGTK dev packages
- Initialized Ghostty submodule

```bash
# Install dev dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev libwebkitgtk-6.0-dev pkg-config build-essential

# Initialize the Ghostty submodule and build the embedded library
git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/build-ghostty.sh

# Build limux
cargo build --release

# Run (point to libghostty-internal.so location)
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=ghostty/zig-out/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./target/release/limux
```

### Package a release tarball

```bash
./scripts/package.sh
```

This builds the binary, bundles `libghostty-internal.so`, icons, and an install script into a tarball.
`package.sh` uses `build-ghostty.sh` to rebuild `libghostty-internal.so` with `ReleaseFast` and `-Dcpu=baseline`, so Zig 0.16.0 and an initialized Ghostty submodule must be present.

## Development

`build-ghostty.sh` records the clean Ghostty commit, library checksum, and resolved
library path next to the artifact. The quality gate and GTK smoke tests reject
missing or stale provenance before starting Cargo or a display session. After
updating the submodule, rebuild with `./scripts/build-ghostty.sh`; linking an
installed library into `ghostty/zig-out/lib` does not establish build provenance.
Use `ZIG=/path/to/zig` to select Zig 0.16.0 and `LIMUX_BUILD_JOBS` to change the
default four build jobs.

Run the canonical local quality gate before committing:

```bash
./scripts/check.sh
```

## Workspace autostart

Right-click a workspace in the sidebar and select **Set Autostart…** to run a
command whenever Limux creates a terminal in that workspace. The command is
stored as part of the workspace session and runs inside the terminal, so
interactive commands such as `ssh user@server` work without modifying `.bashrc`.
Open **Edit Autostart…** and save an empty command to disable it.

Limux writes the command to a private, self-deleting `/bin/sh` script and asks
the interactive terminal shell to source it, so changes such as `cd` and
`export` remain in that shell. Autostart is enabled only when both `command` and
`initial-command` in Ghostty's finalized configuration launch a recognized
POSIX-compatible shell with no arguments other than interactive/login flags.
Non-shell commands such as
`command = direct:/usr/bin/vim` and non-interactive wrappers such as
`command = direct:/bin/bash -lc "exec /usr/bin/vim"` skip autostart, so Limux
does not inject keystrokes into the launched program.

## Agent integrations

Limux ships first-class hooks for coding agents (Codex, Claude Code, and
Gemini CLI). Every terminal limux spawns auto-exports
`LIMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` / `LIMUX_SURFACE_ID` / `LIMUX_PANE_ID` /
`LIMUX_TAB_ID` / `LIMUX_SOCKET`, so the CLI auto-targets the right place
with no flags needed from inside the agent's own terminal.

```bash
# Fire a libadwaita toast + tab/workspace unread badges from any agent
limux notify --subtitle "needs review" --body "blocked on auth choice" "Input needed"

# Install Limux session-restore hooks for supported agents
limux hooks setup

# Drop-in hook handlers translate hook JSON on stdin into notify/session state
echo '{"event":"stop"}' | limux claude-hook --event stop
echo '{"event":"finished"}' | limux gemini-hook --event finished

# Spin up a multi-agent collaboration team — one workspace per agent,
# launches each agent's CLI, and writes AGENTS.md describing the
# <agent-msg> XML protocol so peers can talk to each other:
limux agent-team --agents codex,claude --cwd "$PWD"
# → Codex and Claude can now do:
#   limux send --workspace claude $'<agent-msg from="codex" to="claude" id="…" ts="…">…</agent-msg>\n'

# Or split the current agent's pane and launch another terminal agent.
# Inside Limux, workspace/surface/pane default from LIMUX_*:
limux new-pane --direction right --command claude
# Live GTK self-spawn currently supports terminal panes only.

# Explicit source targets are also accepted and serialized unchanged:
limux new-pane --workspace "$LIMUX_WORKSPACE_ID" --surface "$LIMUX_SURFACE_ID" \
  --pane "$LIMUX_PANE_ID" --direction down --command "codex"

# Keep both agents in the same workspace on separate splits/tabs:
limux identify --json
limux list-panels --workspace "$LIMUX_WORKSPACE_ID"
limux send --workspace "$LIMUX_WORKSPACE_ID" --surface "<peer-surface-id>" \
  $'<agent-msg from="codex" to="claude" id="…" ts="…">…</agent-msg>\n'
```

See the auto-generated `AGENTS.md` (written into the shared cwd) for
the full protocol spec, peer table, and editable Policies section.
`agent-team` refuses to replace an existing `AGENTS.md`, including one from a
previous team, before creating any panes. Preserve or move existing instructions
before running it again, then merge any project policies you want to keep.
`limux --json agent-team --dry-run` previews the protocol in `agents_md_preview`
without writing files or contacting the host.

Checked-in hook templates live in [`hooks/`](hooks/). They mirror
`limux hooks setup` for Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI; OpenCode is
omitted until its hook integration is ready.

Coding agents working on **limux itself** should read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) in the repo root — those cover the build
loop, crate map, and the `feat/cmux-parity` roadmap tracked in
[`docs/cmux-parity-plan.md`](docs/cmux-parity-plan.md).

## Activate an existing window

Bind a desktop global shortcut to `limux activate` to bring the running Limux
window forward without opening another instance or changing its selected
workspace or tab. Use the full executable path in your shortcut if your desktop
does not include Limux's install directory in `PATH`.

The command uses the existing control socket. To target a particular instance:

```bash
limux --socket /path/to/instance.sock activate
```

An explicit `--socket` takes precedence over `LIMUX_SOCKET`, `LIMUX_SOCKET_PATH`,
and the default runtime socket. If no instance is listening there, activation
fails with a socket connection error; it never launches an instance. Running
plain `limux` still launches the app, and independent instances remain supported.

Limux forwards `XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN`, or `DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID` when no token is
available, to GTK. Your compositor decides whether to grant focus, especially
on Wayland where a global shortcut may need a valid activation token. A successful
command means presentation was requested, not that focus was guaranteed.
Socket authentication is unchanged: the default `localUser` policy permits a
shortcut run by the same user; `LIMUX_SOCKET_MODE=limuxOnly` rejects commands
from outside that Limux process's descendants, including desktop shortcuts.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Most host-owned defaults use `Ctrl+Alt` so plain terminal `Ctrl` editing keys pass through. Fullscreen defaults to `F11`. Custom remaps may also use `Cmd`, which Limux maps to either the Linux `Meta` or `Super` modifier. `Opt` maps to `Alt`.

## Architecture

```
rust/
  limux-host-linux/    # GTK4/Adwaita UI (window, sidebar, panes, tabs)
  limux-ghostty-sys/   # FFI bindings to libghostty
  limux-core/          # Command dispatcher and state engine
  limux-protocol/      # Socket wire format types
  limux-control/       # Unix socket server
  limux-cli/           # CLI client
```

The terminal rendering is handled entirely by Ghostty's embedded library (`libghostty-internal.so`), which provides GPU-accelerated OpenGL rendering. The UI layer is native GTK4 with libadwaita.
